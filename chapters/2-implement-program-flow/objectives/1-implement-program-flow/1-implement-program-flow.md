### Implement program flow

#### Evaluating expressions

 - `> , <, >=, <=, !=, ==, ===, && ||`
 - If statements
 - == ignore the underlying data type, === takes into account the underlying datatype
 - Ifs can be nested.
 - Using switch statements (case and default and required break statement)
 = Ternary operators
 - Different array constructors and indexes
 - Array.length
 - The concat method ( combines two arrays)
 - indexOf -> finds index of element, if not found returns -1
 - lastIndexOf
 - join method
 - reverse
 - sort
 - slice -> removes elements and moves them to new array -> end index isn't included
 - splice -> replaced elements in array with specified elements
 - implementing special types of array in js e.g. queue, stack
 - pop and push
 - shift and unshift
 - Array.every(conditionToCheck)
 - Array.some(conditionToCheck)
 - forEach
 - filter ( filter element based on condition into new array filled with elements that pass the condition)
 - map (process every item in an array into new array)
 - for loop and for in loop
 - while loop
 - do while loop (runs at least once)
 - short circuit using *break* and *continue*
